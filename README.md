# MAESTRO: Multi-Agent Explainable System for Textual Rating Omniform

## Overview

MAESTRO, standing for Multi-Agent Explainable System for Textual Rating Omniform, is a cutting-edge AI system designed to grade and analyze textual content across a variety of forms and complexities. Inspired by the Spanish word for "teacher," MAESTRO embodies the essence of guidance and knowledge impartation. It utilizes a multi-agent approach to collaboratively tackle the task, with each agent capable of independent decision-making, yet working in harmony towards a common goal. The system's core lies in its ability to offer transparent, explainable insights into its decision-making processes, much like a skilled educator would. This allows users to understand and evaluate textual content more effectively, enhancing their reading and comprehension skills in our information-saturated world.
